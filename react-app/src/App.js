These days the pitch party is happening virtually, but the outcome is still the same. No-strings-attached money is given to the winner to help them develop the projects that Awesome Kingston thinks will keep Kingston awesome.\n\nThe first micro-grant of 2021 was awarded on Thursday, Jan. 21. Jennifer Ellis, a teacher at the Limestone District School Board pitched Awesome Kingston her Operation Love Literacy project. She wants to provide varied reading materials, including more BIPOC authors, for her students at Ernestown Secondary School in Odessa.\n\n“As an English teacher, my goal is to create better readers, thinkers and communicators in my students by the end of each course,” Ellis shared in an email to Kingstonist. “I think many students have lost the joy of reading, and I want to spark that love for literacy in them.”\n\nWith no bookstore or public library in Odessa, and a closed school library due to COVID-19, Ellis feels students are relying on their classroom teachers for reading material this year.\n\n“The majority of students at our school are white and many have limited experiences with those from different cultures, ethnicities and backgrounds. Reading diverse books can allow students to expand their worldview, develop more empathy and learn new things - without ever needing to leave the comfort of their own homes (which no one is allowed to do right now anyway!)” she said.\n\nThanks to the Awesome Foundation micro-grant Ellis said she was able to purchase 61 books from Bookland at 2800 Princess Street.\n\n“I purchased the books in consultation with my colleagues. Our school runs something called ‘ESS Reads’: every day, regardless of the subject, students are to read independently in their class for at least 10 minutes. I often remind my colleagues in other departments, that I have an extensive classroom library and they are welcome to borrow books for their classes. This Octomester, I compiled a box of books for a science class to use.”\n\nEllis shared a bit of her school day routine: “I start every day in English with independent reading. Students can choose to read whatever book they want - and the only ‘school focus’ is on improving an aspect of their reading (i.e. stamina, quantity, vocabulary, pace, etc.)”\n\n“I have spent more of my own money than I care to count buying books for my classroom library, and to give to students to keep, so they can have access to a variety of materials at different levels to suit their interests. Although we do have a department budget [for classroom materials], it is very limited and usually ‘tapped out’ pretty quickly,” she said.\n\n“I often have students say to me ‘I don’t read’ and it becomes my goal to change their mindset around reading; I always tell my students it’s because they just haven’t found the ‘right’ book yet.”\n\nRead the Operation Love Literacy pitch on the Awesome Kingston website.\n\nThe trustee group is made up of community minded individuals who want to help make Kingston a more awesome city by volunteering time and money to Awesome Kingston. Each of the trustees provides $100 to make up the $1000 microgrant every month. The venues for the pitch parties are provided to the organization at no charge allowing them to put all the monies collected from the trustees into the grant.

More Kingstonians than ever are relying on Kingstonist for their local news. But we need your help to keep it going. A few years ago, two big media conglomerates, Torstar and Postmedia, “swapped assets” and promptly shuttered one of Kingston's main newspapers. We saw talented journalists displaced and years of recorded Kingston history destroyed by a decision made in another city, with interests not grounded in what was best for the Kingston community. And we resolved that we would not permit that to happen again. That's when we decided to take the Kingstonist, at that time a popular Kingston community blog, and reimagine it as the dedicated, independent local news provider you see now. Today, businesses everywhere are struggling under the burdens of COVID-19, and we are no different. So we're asking you to support us. Help us in our mission to: hold our local governments accountable; provide voices for those fighting against social injustice; fight against misinformation; and provide news not censored by the influence of corporate bias. We believe that access to news is an integral component of a healthy community.

across Canada.\n\nMealshare, a national organization committed to helping end youth hunger, and A&W Canada have teamed up to provide meals to youth in need across the country. According to a release from Mealshare, all seven Kingston A&W locations are participating in “Mealshare Mondays”.\n\n“For every ‘Mealshare Item’ purchased at A&W, we’ll share one simple, healthy meal with a youth in need,” said Valerie Ellah, Ottawa Community Leader for Mealshare. “This is the first partnership of its kind to fight youth hunger across the country.”\n\nMealshare says 80 per cent of the financial support stays in local communities where the Mealshare Item is purchased, and 20 per cent goes internationally to Save the Children.\n\n“When choosing charities to receive our funding we look for well established and long standing organizations in the community that focus on providing fresh and healthy food to youth and their families,” Ellah shared with Kingstonist. The local Partners in Mission Food Bank was an obvious choice, she said.\n\nThe Mealshare program began on Monday, Feb. 1, 2021, and Partners in Mission say it is their first experience with this program.\n\n“Partners in Mission Food Bank is very excited with the A&W and Mealshare partnership,” said Dan Irwin, Executive Director of Partners in Mission Food Bank. “This provides a new avenue for our community to help support us. The food bank will receive $1 from every A&W Mealshare meal, which will be used to help provide nutritious food for children.”\n\nEvery Monday, the purchase of a Cheddar Bacon Uncle Burger Combo will provide one meal to a youth in need through Mealshare. Any day of the week, customers can “Make it a Mealshare” by adding $1.00 to their order.\n\nMealshare says they hope to share 1.25 million meals in 2021. A trial of this program, which ran from November 2019 to December 2019 in Saskatchewan and Ottawa, saw 41,640 meals shared with youth in need.\n\n“Our national partnership with Mealshare will help us make a bigger difference with our operators and their teams across the country. Local franchisees from coast to coast are excited to be a part of this program because they’ve seen first-hand the needs in their communities and how these programs can provide immediate benefit and support,” says Susan Senecal, Chief Executive Officer at A&W Canada. “No child should ever go hungry, especially in a country like Canada, so we’re thrilled that we can be a part of this initiative.”\n\nPartners in Mission would like to remind everyone that they are here to help. If you need a food hamper, please call them at 613-544-4100.\n\nMealshare believes nutritious food is essential for all children, especially when 1 in 5 children are food insecure in this country. They are committed to creating a world where it’s easier to share with those in need, and every child and youth is fed as a result.\n\nMealshare was founded in 2013 with four partner restaurants in Alberta. The organization has expanded to 1200+ restaurants across Canada and partnering with A&W Canada is the next milestone for the organization.\n\nThe social enterprise has provided over 3.8 million meals since inception, with their simple “Buy One, Give One” model. Canadians can purchase a Mealshare menu item at a participating restaurant and one meal will be donated to youth struggling with hunger through our network of local city charity partners and our international partner, Save the Children Canada.\n\nFor more information, visit the Mealshare website.", "categories": [ { "confident": true, "id": "IAB8", "label": "Food & Drink", "level": 1,

But we need your help to keep it going. A few years ago, two big media conglomerates, Torstar and Postmedia, “swapped assets” and promptly shuttered one of Kingston's main newspapers. We saw talented journalists displaced and years of recorded Kingston history destroyed by a decision made in another city, with interests not grounded in what was best for the Kingston community. And we resolved that we would not permit that to happen again. That's when we decided to take the Kingstonist, at that time a popular Kingston community blog, and reimagine it as the dedicated, independent local news provider you see now. Today, businesses everywhere are struggling under the burdens of COVID-19, and we are no different. So we're asking you to support us. Help us in our mission to: hold our local governments accountable; provide voices for those fighting against social injustice; fight against misinformation; and provide news not censored by the influence of corporate bias. We believe that access to news is an integral component of a healthy community.

Live Free Counselling Services in Toronto in 2016, she had a specific vision for what she wanted to create. She’d completed her Masters of Social Work at Ryerson University, researching the experiences of young Black girls in Canadian society, and had worked with youth in Kingston and Toronto. Now she was ready to build her own space. “A lot of my practice at Live Free is based on some hard experiences in life,” Franklin said. A noticeably calm and positive person, Franklin specializes in counselling services for families, youth and women. She said being a Black woman with her own practice also gave her another early and unexpected differentiator when starting out. “Even in a city like Toronto, there have not always been a lot of Black therapists available within our community, who have their own private practice. When I started Live Free you could go on Psychology Today,” an online therapist directory, “enter ‘Toronto or ‘Mississauga’, and I would be one of the only faces that would come up.” Soon Franklin said she noticed a trend of Black clients reaching out, expressing relief to have found someone that would be able to relate to certain aspects of their lives. “They said ‘I just wanted someone that could understand certain things,’” she said, such as the sometimes subtle expressions of racism in Canadian society, and the complex, nuanced experience of a Black identity. She said offering that service felt like a way to uplift her community. “It’s like fighting back, providing a safe space for people of colour, for them to be able to rest as a form of resistance, to be able to take care of themselves as a form of activism, to be able to really take off the mask that we have to wear every day to walk through different spaces that are not for us, or safe to us. Live Free is kind of like my love letter to people like me.” In her Masters research at Ryerson, Franklin dug into what she said is a common shared experience of young Black women — the stress of having to change which “version” of themselves they project in order to be accepted in certain spaces. “We started to call that ‘our mask,’ wearing different faces in different places. The stress and anxiety that it creates, having to take off one version of who you are and put on another one,” she said. “At work, for example, we may have to ignore a lot of microaggressions and hold our feelings in. We may have to do that as a way to literally keep our jobs,” she explained. “It’s like an armour that we may have to wear as a way to move up or be successful.” Franklin runs Live Free promoting a message of rest and joy, prioritizing self care for her clients. It’s a message that she said she feels Black women in particular may have not always heard. “There are not always a lot of people telling us that it’s okay to take care of ourselves. That’s where that self care base of my work is coming from.” A large part of her work now is also mentoring other Black therapists, she said. “People that are just coming up, that want to eventually run their own practice. We’re just showing them how empowering it can be to empower others. That’s a big part of what we’re doing right now.” Franklin moved to Kingston as a child, at the end of elementary school. With her parents still residents, she considers it her hometown. When her family arrived, Franklin remembers her mother looking for ways to be more connected and engaged, helping others. “She wanted to be a more constructive member of her community. It was important for us to volunteer together, do community work together and just be more involved.” Franklin remembers it as a turning point in her own life. “She passed that down to me and I decided I wanted to do more to give back.” She started off working at the Boys and Girls Club of Kingston. “I was doing youth programs and different initiatives that they had. They would send me to Toronto and other places to facilitate workshops for youth. We would do fundraising initiatives. That’s where a lot of my social work roots came from,” she recalls. She then left Kingston for Toronto where she worked at a grassroots organization called Sketch. “It’s basically a youth organization that focuses on art-based support for young people who are at risk of homelessness, or who are experiencing homelessness and significant mental health challenges,” she said. “That agency was defining for a lot of other anti-oppressive and grassroots elements that I incorporate in with my day-to-day practice now,” she added. “Our staff meetings would happen on the floor with pillows in a circle. We would talk about what’s happening in the world and our lives. There would be a big paper in the middle, and we would all be writing or drawing on it.” She said working at Sketch gave her an inspiring experience of unity and equality. “People would say that when you walked into Sketch, you couldn’t tell which people worked there. It gave me this real feeling that we shouldn’t be defined by what we look like, our race, our class, our gender,” she said. That was not something she remembered feeling in Kingston. “I love Kingston for so many things that it gave me, like my passion for social work,” she said. “Growing up as a Black woman in society, I think especially in Kingston, it allowed me to see things that I wanted to change in society. I experienced a lot of inadvertent and direct racism as a result of being one of the only Black people in my class, in my school, in my neighbourhood.” Returning regularly, with both family and friends in town, she said she has seen Kingston transform over the years. “I think that it’s changed a lot. We all still have work that we can do. I definitely try to be someone who constantly is working towards making those changes.” Franklin was in Kingston during the summer of 2020, one that saw people all over the world unite to support the Black Lives Matter movement, decry white supremacy and racist violence. Marches, protests and creative projects took place across North America, including in Kingston. Kingston’s Black Luck Collective hosted a vigil on Tuesday, Jun. 2, 2020 “to mourn the lives lost to anti-Black Racism in Canada and the lives that continue to be impacted by anti-Black Racism in Canada.” At first Franklin was hesitant to attend. “When it came up I was like ‘I don’t know.’ It’s almost retraumatizing to go to these events because it brings up experiences that you’ve really tried to shut out. I was having mixed feelings.” When she arrived, Franklin said she was overcome with a rush of emotion. “I’m walking into the park and it’s a circle, and all these different people are coming in from all these different directions towards the circle. I had thought ‘it’s probably going to be so small.’” However approximately 800 people attended. “Just seeing the amount of people, the vision of it was so overwhelming. I broke down. It was so beautiful, to be in a place where I kind of learned what racism is, it was a full-circle moment. It was just so emotional for me, because I felt like ‘oh my gosh, people are really wanting to make these changes here.’ “For a place that I consider my home city, it was just so powerful. It has stayed with me and made me feel a lot of hope for this city… I commend the leaders of that event because they definitely made it feel like everyone was one. It was just such a unity project.” “It almost felt like — this is going to sound strange — like the apology I needed,” she added. “This was a commitment from the whole community to make change, like we’re waking up.” As the summer wore on, Franklin said she noticed it taking a toll on the people around her. Stories of racist violence continued to make headlines, while anti-racist activism became the centre of heated political division in the United States. All the while, the COVID-19 pandemic carried on. “It was impacting me personally, my family, my friends, those that I work with,” she said. While she knew there were probably many members of the Black community that could be benefiting from therapy, for many the cost made it inaccessible. “There are a lot of people who see therapy as a luxury,” she said. “Maybe they don’t have benefits or they’re struggling financially.” To solve this, Franklin decided to launch something called the Black Mental Health Fund (BMHF), to subsidize or fully cover the cost of service for clients of colour. “We wanted to be able to offer this other option that says ‘Come. Come as you are, tell us about your needs, and we will provide that support at a supremely reduced cost.’” Franklin started off by crowd-funding, and then progressed to fundraising through the launch of an online clothing store, the Self Care Shop Toronto. “All the proceeds go to our BMHF as well. Along the way we’ve had community partners, artists, doing things for us at no cost to contribute to the fund. Everything — from the person who supplied the logo, to the person who gets us the shirts, who prints them — everyone is donating at least in part their time, their effort, their creativity to the fund.” The shop sold out at the end of December. Due to high demand for the black and white ‘Self Care’ clothing line she is working to restock it for a second round of sales. “Our goal is to raise $10,000 and we have raised 50 per cent,” she said. Besides the subsidized therapy sessions Franklin has also started offering free community wellness workshops. “Because of the pandemic, they’ve been online. That’s great because some of our workshops have had attendees from across the world — Guyana, from different parts of Canada, northern regions that have just never had access to people of colour leading in the wellness space, or maybe haven’t felt safe in their communities. They’re coming and having this opportunity to do a workshop online 100 per cent free.” The final component of the BMHF is mentorship. “We’re doing some youth mentorship, and also some therapist mentorship as well.” As the second month of 2021 begins, Franklin said she is feeling positive and poised to press on. “We’re redefining self care, diversifying what wellness means, and now providing funding for those who wouldn’t otherwise be able to access therapy,” she said. Despite having an eye on the big picture, she said the grassroots feeling of her practice has not changed. “At the core, I like to call it keepin’ it real social work,” she said. “I’m not coming in to tell you what your life should be. You’re in the driver’s seat, I’m in the passenger seat. Honestly I think a lot of people’s shoulders go down when they hear that.” Samantha Butler-Hassan, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, kingstonist.com", "categories": [ { "confident": true, "id":

Thus far the city has paid $238,000 of that pledge. Susan Creasy, chair of the volunteer committee for the foundation, explained the importance of the support from Quinte West. “Given the magnitude of work to be done, the next phase of Kingston's health care modernization has the potential to touch every citizen in south-eastern Ontario. This is an ambitious project, but with incredible support like yours together we can accomplish great things.” The modernization of Kingston General Hospital is a massive project expected to span across the next seven years approximately. The massive renovation involves taking down four buildings on the current KGH campus to build a new and modernized patient tower. Emergency room expansion, new labs, surgical suites, neonatal intensive care unit and two 36-bed in-patient floors are just some of the features of the new expansion. During the presentation Tom Zsolnay, president and CEO of UHKF, presented numbers that showed how important the connection between Quinte West and Kingston Health Sciences Centre is. In 2020, there were 574 in-patients in KHSC facilities as well as 10,301 outpatients and surgical care patients from Quinte West. That marks a 35% increase in in-patients and a 29% increase in outpatients and surgical patients from Quinte West since 2015. Zsolnay also remarked that 21% of the population of Quinte West accesses outpatient and surgical care annually. One of the most significant numbers presented was the number of Quinte West residents visiting KHSC cancer centres. On average, there are 4,560 visits to the cancer centre from Quinte West residents. Since 2015 there has been a 29% increase in patients accessing cancer centre care from Quinte West. Quinte West Mayor Jim Harrison stressed the importance of the city's support of KHSC. “We're stronger together and you've just indicated just how strong we are, and how much you're doing to be able to look after, as you say, a seamless healthcare system” Zsolnay explained that the Ministry of Health expanded the scope of the project in 2019 which increased the local share amount for the project to $115 million. The RFP period for the project is expected to begin in the fall of 2021 with the contract expected to be awarded in the spring of 2022. Design and construction is expected to take place from 2022 through 2028.", "categories": [ { "confident": true, "id": "IAB7", "label": "Health & Fitness", "level": 1, "links": { "self":

There are only a handful of qualified historical tradespeople in the Kingston area, and they don't use power tools in order to keep their work authentic. “We are fortunate that we found measured drawings that were done in the 1930s by Dr. Eric Arthur Students, who was a professor of architecture at (University of Toronto),” he says. “So these drawings gave insight to what the front facade really looked like.” Restoring historic buildings is no easy task — it is a long, arduous process that requires dedication and commitment. “I'm just the custodian of this property,” Panageotopoulos says. “It's a responsibility, when you have a property like this, to care for it.” Panageotopoulos' home. also known as the Davy House, received the award from the Frontenac Heritage Foundation, along with a limestone farmhouse on Bath Road that was built over 150 years ago. Normally, the foundation gives out more than two awards each year, but due to the coronavirus pandemic, they were forced to cancel their awards gala. So they decided to shave the number down to two and made feature video pieces on each winner. “We just didn't want to let a year go by without any awards,” says Shirley Bailey, president of the Frontenac Heritage Foundation.

There are only a handful of qualified historical tradespeople in the Kingston area, and they don’t use power tools in order to keep their work authentic.\n\t\n\t“We are fortunate that we found measured drawings that were done in the 1930s by Dr. Eric Arthur Students, who was a professor of architecture at (University of Toronto),” he says. “So these drawings gave insight to what the front facade really looked like.”\nRestoring historic buildings is no easy task — it is a long, arduous process that requires dedication and commitment.\n“I’m just the custodian of this property,” Panageotopoulos says. “It’s a responsibility, when you have a property like this, to care for it.”\nPanageotopoulos’ home. also known as the Davy House, received the award from the Frontenac Heritage Foundation, along with a limestone farmhouse on Bath Road that was built over 150 years ago.\nNormally, the foundation gives out more than two awards each year, but due to the coronavirus pandemic, they were forced to cancel their awards gala. So they decided to shave the number down to two and made feature video pieces on each winner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStory continues below

Foundation.\nThe foundation has been giving out these awards since 1982 to both heritage homeowners and the tradespeople who work on the projects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t© 2021 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "categories": [ { "confident": false, "id": "IAB10-5",
